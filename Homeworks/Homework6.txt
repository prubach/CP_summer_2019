Please write a program that opens a text file containing some text (for example a newspaper article - only text). The program should list all the words used in this text and count how many times every one of those words appears in this text file.
Hints:
1. You may use the Map structure.
2. Remove all special symbols (.,:;$) before adding to the map.
3. Make everything lower case before adding to the map.
